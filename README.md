# FaceDetection

1. Download Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)  and Python 3.11.5 64-bit here (https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
2. Make sure the Python package is not version 3.11.6 or higher because TensorFlow does not support that version yet.
3. Use the 'git clone https://github.com/12shadow12/FaceDetection' command to download all the project files from my GitHub.
4. To get the program running with all its dependencies run: 
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   note: if there issues with the dependencies delete the venv folder and create a new virtual environment using this command: python -m venv venv . Then try installing requirements.txt again from step 4.
   
5. Then execute and run the real_time_face_detect.py file
